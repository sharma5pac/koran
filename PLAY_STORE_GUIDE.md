# How to Publish Your App to the Google Play Store

Congratulations on building your app! Here is the step-by-step process to get **NUR-QURAN** published on the Google Play Store.

## Step 1: Create a Google Play Console Account
1.  Go to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/signup).
2.  Sign in with your Google Account.
3.  Accept the Developer Distribution Agreement.
4.  Pay the **$25 (one-time)** registration fee.
5.  Complete your account details (identity verification).

## Step 2: Create Your App
1.  In the Play Console, click **Create app**.
2.  **App Name:** Enter "NUR-QURAN".
3.  **Default Language:** English (or your preferred language).
4.  **App or Game:** Select **App**.
5.  **Free or Paid:** Select **Free**.
6.  Accept the declarations and click **Create app**.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Store Listing
Go to **Grow > Store presence > Main store listing**.
1.  **Short Description:** A catchy one-line summary (max 80 chars).
2.  **Full Description:** Detail the features (Prayer times, Qibla, Quran, etc.).
3.  **Graphics:**
    *   **App Icon:** 512x512 PNG (Use the one we generated!).
    *   **Feature Graphic:** 1024x500 JPG or PNG.
    *   **Phone Screenshots:** Upload at least 2 screenshots.

## Step 4: Complete App Content
Go to the **App Content** section (at the bottom of the left menu). You must complete all tasks:
1.  **Privacy Policy:** You need a URL. You can generate a free one online (e.g., using Flycricket or a Google Doc).
2.  **Ads:** Declare if your app contains ads (No).
3.  **App Access:** Select "All functionality is available without special access".
4.  **Content Ratings:** Fill out the questionnaire (Rating: Everyone).
5.  **Target Audience:** Select your target age group (e.g., 13+).
6.  **News Apps:** Select "No".
7.  **Data Safety:** Important! Declare what data you collect (Location for Qibla/Prayer times, etc.).

## Step 5: Upload Your App Bundle (.aab)
**Crucial Note:** You cannot upload the `.apk` file you just tested. You must upload a **Signed App Bundle (.aab)**.
I can generate this file for you now.

1.  Go to **Release > Production**.
2.  Click **Create new release**.
3.  (First time) Click **Choose signing key** > **Use Google-generated key** (Recommended).
4.  Upload the `.aab` file I will build for you.
5.  Enter release notes (e.g., "Initial release of NUR-QURAN").
6.  Click **Next** and review any warnings.

## Step 6: Review and Rollout
1.  Go to **Release > Production**.
2.  Click **Start rollout to Production**.
3.  Your app will go into "In Review" status. This usually takes **1-3 days** (sometimes longer for new accounts).
4.  Once approved, it will be live on the Play Store!
